Part 1:

Runtime of equalLists() is O(N), because the runtime is dependent on the length of the smaller of the two lists,
so if there 10 items in the smallest list, it will take 10 times as long if the smallest list only had 1 item.

Part 2:

Runtime of terminates() is O(N), because this algorithm also depends on the length of the list, such that it will take
5 times longer to find out if a list with 5 elements is recursive compared to a list with 1 element

Part 3:

SlowMaxStack - Runtime of getMaxSoFar() is O(N), because it has to go through every element in the list each time to
determine the max value. Runtime of push() and pop() are both constant because we are only ever accessing the top of the list to add
or remove one single item

FastMaxStack - Runtime of getMaxSoFar() is constant, because it accesses the maximum value which is located in helper.info and doesn't
have to go through the entire original list. Runtime of push() and pop() are both constant because we are only ever adding or 
removing one item from/to the top of the list
